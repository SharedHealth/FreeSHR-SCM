Setting up the control server

You would need to install epel repo from the following location

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
#+END_SRC

Once that is done, you can setup the control server by installing the following packages

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  yum install https://github.com/SharedHealth/FreeSHR-SCM/raw/master/dist/shr_scm_utils-0.1-1.noarch.rpm
  yum install https://github.com/SharedHealth/FreeSHR-SCM/raw/master/dist/shr_scm-0.1-1.noarch.rpm
#+END_SRC

Please ensure that the home directory on the target system is not mounted with noexec flag.
